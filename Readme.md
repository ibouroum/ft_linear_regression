# Ft Linear Regression

First of the projects in the machine learning area at 42 network.
The objective of this project is to introduce you to the basic concept behind machine learning.<br/>
For this project, you will have to create a  a linear regression function in the language of choise (python3), train the model on the given dataset, save generated thethas and use them to predict car price depending on it's mileage.

## Required Modules:
First you should install the following modules and packages:
- Python
- Pip
- `pip install pandas`
- `pip install matplotlib`


## For Training the model and Visualising data use:

USAGE : `python ft_linear.py ./{yourdataset}`

## Plots :

## Predict the Price for a given mileage:

Using the Parameters tuned with the trained model using the given dataset, i can predict the price of a car for a mileage given as input by the User.<br/>
USAGE : `python predict.py`

# For exemple : 

Enter mileage: 15231<br/>
The price of this care is : 8147.516060000001 euros
